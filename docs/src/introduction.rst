Overview
--------
PyMoDAQ-BeamShaping is a **PyMoDAQ extension** for **spatial beam shaping** using **Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs)**.
It bridges **numerical simulations** and **experimental implementations** by providing:

- Algorithms for phase retrieval (Gerchberg-Saxton, IFTA, MRAF, etc.).
- Real-time visualization of input, modulator, and output fields.
- SLM calibration (gray levels → phase mapping).
- Phase corrections (Zernike, focal, linear).
- Compatibility with ``pymodaq_data`` for ``.h5beam`` files (HDF5-based).

Computational spatial beam shaping is widely used to generate tailored optical fields for applications
ranging from **optical trapping and microscopy** to **laser processing and quantum photonics** (see below).

   **Figure 1:** General beam-shaping problem and algorithm steps.
   A laser beam incident in an **input plane** is modulated in a **modulator plane**,
   with the objective of generating, in an **output plane**, an optical field as close as possible
   to a prescribed complex target field (eventually restrained within a region of interest).
   The **2f** and **4f** optical configurations are shown in (b).
